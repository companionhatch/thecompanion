           <p>Hello,</p>
           <p>We are <em>The Companion</em>.</p>
           <p>We’re a cohort of Calgarians who write about art in our hometown and this is our website.</p>
           <p>You might call it “art criticism.” It’s okay if you do, because we value the role of critical pauses and rewinds when it comes to cultural things. It's what drives us. But please know that we carry no hammers or hatchets and there will be no star ratings or thumbs involved. And while we do possess long-ago Humanities degrees — now fingerprints on our résumés — we don’t really care for heavy intellectual machinery or disinterested judgments from on high.</p>
           <p>We prefer to be in the midst of things, tinkering with our thoughts and feelings around <em>what just happened</em>. We are infinitely interested in the forces put into play by the cultural lifeforms of this city and we want to share this interestedness with you.</p>
           <p>You can expect more-or-less regular heaps of irregular texts that respond to the cultural goings-on of this town, both past and present. Stay in the loop by adding us to your RSS feed (if people still use those?) or click subscribe below to receive our newsletter. You can also follow us on Instagram or Twitter.</p>
           <p>Thank you for reading.</p>
           <p>Your companions,</p>
           <p>Klerp,</p>
           <p>Perfnid,</p>
           <p>& Mirge*</p>

           <p><blockquote><em>*(Klerp, Perfnid, and Mirge are the parallel yet highly variant heteronyms of Patrick Close. Each have their own personalities and sometimes engage in dialogue with one another. <strong>Q:</strong> Why? <strong>A:</strong> Playful whimsy and creative latitude, mostly, but it also seems useful and closer to the truth to drop the idea that anyone is just one thing who views the world in just one way, even at any one moment in time.)</em></blockquote></p>
