           <h3>Who are you really?</h3>
           <p>Patrick Close. I'm a white male settler and I work as a technical writer in Calgary, Alberta. I am also a grant writer and researcher for <a href="https://www.insideouttheatre.com/">Inside Out Theatre</a>.</p> 
           <p>Years ago, I graduated with a BA in English + Philosophy. I wrote about sound culture, technology, and political aesthetics. Over the past decade, I've been an editor of an arts and literary magazine, an occasional facilitator, researcher, band member, zine maker, and an one-time published poet (in a journal that no longer exists).</p>
           <p>I'm currently working on an art project called <em>Fond of Madness</em> — a fictional archive that tells a story about mental illness through the lens of a group (actually, a town) rather than an individual.</p>
           <h3>What's with the website?</h3>
           <p>The simplicity of this site shows my limitation as a web developer (which I am not) but also reflects three of my core values around communication: <br> (1) <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/">accessibility</a>, (2) deliberate engagement, and (3) the ability to question, experiment, and compose with the forms we use to communicate "content."</p>
           <p>I think that social media platforms sacrifice all three values, which is why I am here and not there. I wish for better venues. For now, we swim.</p>
           <h3>How can I get in touch?</h3>
           <p>Say hello by emailing me at companionhatch@gmail.com</p>
           <p>Unfortunately, at the risk of no one ever knowing that this site exists, I am not on social media (see above).</p>
