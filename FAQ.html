           <h3>Who are you really?</h3>
           <p>Patrick Close. I'm a white male settler and I work as a technical writer in Calgary, Alberta. I am also a grant writer and researcher for <a href="https://www.insideouttheatre.com/">Inside Out Theatre</a>.</p> 
           <p>Years ago, I graduated with a BA in English + Philosophy. I wrote about sound culture, technology, and political aesthetics. Over the past decade, I've been an editor of an arts and literary magazine, an occasional facilitator, researcher, band member, zine maker, and an one-time published poet (in a journal that no longer exists).</p>
           <p>I'm currently working on an art project called <em>Fond of Madness</em> â€” a fictional archive that tells a story about mental illness through the lens of a group (actually, a town) rather than an individual.</p>
           <h3>What's with the website?</h3>
           <p>The simplicity of this site shows my limitation as a web developer (which I am not) but also reflects three essential values about <em>how</em> we communicate: <br> (1) <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/">accessibility</a>, (2) concentration, and (3) intention.</p>
           <p>I believe social media platforms, which we use but do not own, sacrifice all three, and are the worst possible means to realize what is best and most valuable: human connection. For me, the reasons to go onto these platforms are the same as going to a friend's show at the most decrepit bar in town where you can't hear or see anyone and everything smells a bit ugly. Let there be better venues. But for now we dance and make do.</p>
           <h3>How can I get in touch?</h3>
           <p>Say hello by emailing me at companionhatch@gmail.com</p>
           <p>Unfortunately, at the risk of no one ever knowing that this site exists, I am not on social media (see above).</p>
